    <h2>PhenoCam ROI: An interactive Region of Interest (ROI) delineator for the PhenoCam database</h2>
    <p>In order to extract time series data from a series of images, one needs to : <br/>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1) delineate a region of interest (ROI); <br/>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) create a mask file identifying pixles of interest; and<br/>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3) calculate averaged values of particular bands (e.g. Green Chromatic Coordinate or GCC) over a time period.<br/> <br/>
    However, these steps are painstaking and need special accuracy. The PhenoCam ROI tool provides an interactive web interface to facilitate these process of large imagery datasets. This document is a simple guide to explain different elements of the PhenoCam ROI and their functionality.</p>

    <h3>Easiest way is to use runGitHub</h3>
    <p>The following command will check for all the required R packages, install them if needed and run the drawROI app directly from GitHub. However, latest version of R should be already installed. The app requires pre-installed GDAL and basic image rendering libraries (png, jpeg, tif, etc.) on the operating system.</p>
    <pre lang="{r,"><code>library(shiny)<br/>runGitHub("drawROI", "bnasr")</code></pre>
    <br/>
    <p>The R package is developed and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/bnasr" target="_blank">Bijan Seyednarollah</a>.</p>
    <p>Most recent release is available from: <a href="https://github.com/bnasr/drawROI" target="_blank">https://github.com/bnasr/drawROI</a></p>
